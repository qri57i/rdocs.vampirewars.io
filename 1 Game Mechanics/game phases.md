## Inception Phase

The first phase of the game is planned to be released in May 2022 (TBD). When released, you will be able to connect your wallet to the game and access the world’s map. 

What to expect:
 - **Map exploration** and possibility to choose the perfect locations for your crypts. Crypt location is important for your strategy, since vampires only hunt at night, and the game’s time zones are synced with real world time zones. TIP: Choose your locations based on when you plan to access the game. This way you make sure that your vampires can hunt when you are available to play. 
 - **Hunting**. You can send your vampires to hunt. A vampire can hunt only if they have a crypt. We strongly recommend hunting outside the big cities, since population density affects your vampire speed. They need to stay hidden, so the more humans in the zone, the slower they advance. Also, in very rare cases, raids were reported where groups of humans fought back the vampires, inflicted damage and even stole impermanent items or artefacts. 
 - **Vampire upgrading**. As you hunt, you receive experience and your vampire can be upgraded 
 - **Craft** items to boost your speed and hunting performance
 - **Expand your territory** around the crypt. 
 - **Upgrade your crypt** to be able to expand even more
 - During your hunts you will get the chance to **create a new vampire** that you can keep for yourself and use as another character of yours, or you can sell it for profits. Since there is no other way to join the game than to own a vampire and the only vampires in the game are the ones existing players create, you are the character supply owner of the game. 


## Clans and Collaboration Phase

The Clans will be introduced in a second phase, afte the Vampires start converting victims to more Vampires after the secondary market sales cool down and the HBLO liquidity stabilizes. We expect high HBLO volatility after the release, which is normal for all token launches. 

In this phase, planned in late August 2022, you will be able to create Clans, create alliances with other players, build teritorry control strategies based on crypts and land owned and benefit of the opportunities of building micro-communities, collaborating on expansion and grow your clan & vampires. 

What to expect:
- **Create your own clan** and invite other players to join
- **Decide on teritorry expansion** by voting where the clan should expand. This will have an impact in the price for land in that area (cheaper for your clan, more expensive for the others)
- **Clan teritorry will enhance skills**, meaning that clan's vampires are fastern the teritorry, hunt better, and discover more items and artifacts
- **Clan treasury** will make your MERCs produce more HBLO at a lower stake
- **Vampire sharing** between clan members will be possible, so no Vampire will rest while you are afk.


## PvP Arena and Wars Phase

The endgame. 

Planned in Q1 - Q2 2023, the PvP gameplay layer will added. We plan to use WEBGL technology and expand to other platforms, Mobile being the favorite in the team he moment. 

The main mechanics in this phase (and the first iteration) will be the combat between Vampires that meet while hunting. This will have major effects in HBLO looting durring map exploration. Important wealth transfers will happen since heavy players will combat other heavy players and blood will be spilled.

Arenas and Wars will also be released, where you and your clan will be able to enter in massive confrontations with other players and clans. Blood will be spilled, Items and Artifacts will be lost, territory shifts will transform the Vampire world. 

What to expect:
- **Encountering another Vampire on the maap** will trigger instant combat. Depending on your Vampire's level, mounted items and artefacts you can win or lose. HBLO will be at stake, impermanent and magical items will be at stake, a lot can happen in a hunting encounter. Map combats will be on **auto fight**
- **Arenas** will be accessible on the map. Fighting will be PVP. 
- **Wars** can be declared, with HBLO, teritorry and any assets at stake.
