## Inception Phase

The first phase of the game is planned to be released in May 2022 (TBD). When released, you will be able to connect your wallet to the game and access the world’s map. 

What to expect:
 - **Map exploration** and possibility to choose the perfect locations for your crypts. Crypt location is important for your strategy, since vampires only hunt at night, and the game’s time zones are synced with real world time zones. TIP: Choose your locations based on when you plan to access the game. This way you make sure that your vampires can hunt when you are available to play. 
 - **Hunting**. You can send your vampires to hunt. A vampire can hunt only if they have a crypt. We strongly recommend hunting outside the big cities, since population density affects your vampire speed. They need to stay hidden, so the more humans in the zone, the slower they advance. Also, in very rare cases, raids were reported where groups of humans fought back the vampires, inflicted damage and even stole impermanent items or artefacts. 
 - **Vampire upgrading**. As you hunt, you receive experience and your vampire can be upgraded 
 - **Craft** items to boost your speed and hunting performance
 - **Expand your territory** around the crypt. 
 - **Upgrade your crypt** to be able to expand even more
 - During your hunts you will get the chance to **create a new vampire** that you can keep for yourself and use as another character of yours, or you can sell it for profits. Since there is no other way to join the game than to own a vampire and the only vampires in the game are the ones existing players create, you are the character supply owner of the game.
