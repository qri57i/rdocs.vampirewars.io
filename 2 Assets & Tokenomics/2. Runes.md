# The Runes

![](/Static/rune1.jfif)-

The Runes are maybe the most important Assets in the game.

Rune owners can masivvely benefit of the game without even playing. Runes give their owners "Founder" status and access to a passive revenue stream from profit sharing of secondary market royalties for all NFTs in the game, ever, HBLO fees and many more. 

For Rune owners who choose to play the game, the benefits are even greater:
- **Placing the Rune on the map** will create a "blessed land" area around it where all vampires will have some super-cool enhancements. Our favorite one is victim conversion rate increase... even for the Modern Vampires. Also, the Rune Owner will receive a share of the minting cost for all Vampires minted on their teritorry. Deciding with whom to share the location it's a very strategical decision.
- **Runes in the Clan** - Having a Rune (or more) in the Clan will give major benefits for all Clan Members.
- **Owned Vampires** will have extra perks if in the same wallet with the Rune
