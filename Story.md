 ## The Beginning

On a barely formed Earth, still shaped by meteors, from the unknown vast space, 666 runes fell on the planet.
The mystical runes, stones with well defined shape, writings and immense power, buried deep within the earth, awaited for life to thrive on the planet to manifest their purpose. Humans evolved and the Runes activated and genetically altered 666 humans, transforming them into what we now know as vampires.

The vampires worshiped the Runes that empowered the most pure of their bloodlines and provided them the ability to breed and grow. 

666 vampires roamed the planet, the ancient ones, pure bloodlines that thrived, built clans, expanded their territories while hunting for animals at night and resting during the day. They fought each other over territories to claim the hunting grounds.

The Runes provided protection and immortality, the vampires performed rituals and gifted blood to the mystical objects. The unbreakable cycle has gone uninterrupted for millions of years. Life thrived on earth in perfect balance.

Until the great wars. Humans evolved, built their empires, migrated and occupied the planet.
Vampires followed the food, territories got smaller and smaller while their greed became bigger and bigger.

The land was the provider for the vampires, they constantly fought for territory in order to have their clan thrive. Their battles were almost rituals in their history, they were held between representatives from each clan, their best warriors. The losing side would always seize the land to the winner.


## The Humans

They evolved from apelike ancestors  millions of years ago. Over hundreds of thousands of years humanity evolved and eventually met their predators.   

They learned about the discrete species, accepted their role in the trophic chain and, in secret groups, with the same discretion, they fought them. Because vampires always hid in the dark, it was nearly impossible to prove their existence. The encounters always became stories, myths and only a small group of people were aware of their existence.
 
They were frightened by the vampires being superior creatures and they did everything they could to fight them. They eventually started to imprison and kill vampires, the humans were cunning, they searched for their lairs and attacked the vampires at day.


## Wars and Extinction

The vampire clans had different views for their survival and the clash between them intensified, fighting in gruesome battles. The conflict between them weakened the Runes' protection. Rituals were still kept, the cycle was still unbreakable, but the thriving was fading, hunger got incontrolable, judgement was blurred and conflict only divided them as a species.They were prone to get discovered by the humans and that would eventually get all of them killed. 

For centuries, humans captured, killed and imprisoned vampires. The Ancient ones that couldn’t be killed were kept in underground prisons where they slept and slept in a hibernation state for years. 

On April 12, 1910, in a small city in Japan, during a great earthquake, one of the Runes was discovered while people searched for survivors. Little did they know what it was and they removed it from the ground. Runes deactivated. Vampire immortality halted and all of them died by old age in the following years. Except for the Ancients that fell asleep in the underground prisons. 

Vampires were forgotten, only the myths and stories remained. 



## The Awakening

In 2021, September, in a remote location in Romania, in a calm Autumn time with tree leaves that started to get their rusty skin, wind slowly blowing over the vast forest, everything was about to change. The humans dug out of the ground the first of the six thousand six hundred sixty six vampire ancient Runes. They were amazed by the stone's shape and writings and they were almost attracted to it. 

The Rune had been studied for almost a year in Romania, until one day when scientists decided to transfer the object to a laboratory in Geneva. This is when a drop of blood touched the Rune by accident. 

Little did they know that their action would actually start a world round rune wake. All the runes activated in an almost mystical way, at night watching the ground. From high above one could see glimmering lights, almost as small auroras on top of the places where the runes were buried and the humans started to dig all out being mesmerized by their mystical power which they did not understand. 

The runes’ activation was not the only mystical thing happening, the ancient vampires, the most pure of their bloodline, started to wake, deformed by the time they were asleep and imprisoned, hungry, mad and more powerful than ever. 

The ancient vampires broke out searching for their precious runes, they were now awake on a new earth. Humans evolved so much, technology was all over but the vampire rage was not a match. It didn't take long and the vampires brought gifts to their runes that they stole back from humans, leaving the latter questioning how that could happen. Humans never thought about the hidden part in their history, the vampires.

Through their rituals and runes, the ancient vampires succeeded to reviving fallen sons and daughters from different times in the history. They learned that the Runes’ power hasn't changed. Their thirst was still uncontrollable and the only way they could create more vampires was to transform their victims. They built their armies in the shadow, hidden from human sight, travelling underground and feeding at night. 

Soon, the battle for land was revived too. 

The fight for territory was about to start, the reclaim was beginning.
